# Change LED With Tweet
- Description: This project aims to let you change the color of an LED with a tweet, or turn on a particular color with that same tweet.
- Made for a `Create A Light` project for my Lighting Productuon (THEATRE 338) class at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee

## Rough outline:
- Tweet a color to a twitter account
- The ESP32 will ask twitter for the most recent tweet on that account
- The ESP32 will then parse the tweet for the color
- The ESP32 will then change the color of the LED to the color specified in the tweet


## How to run yourself:
- WIP - No instructions yet
- Fritzing diagram and parts list to come
